I. To find the average Departure Delay of all flights in minutes.
	   SELECT avg(DepDelay) from flightsInfo;  
		Output = 9.58 minutes


1. 
INSERT OVERWRITE DIRECTORY '/user/training/hiveOutput/delay_airports' select origin,count(if(DepDelay > 19.16, "", NULL)) as delayed_2avg,
count(*) as total_Flights,count(if(DepDelay > 19.16, "", NULL)) / count(*) as delayed_Rate from flightsInfo 
group by origin order by delayed_Rate desc;

2.
INSERT OVERWRITE DIRECTORY '/user/training/hiveOutput/delay_airlines' select month,uniquecarrier,count(if(DepDelay > 19.16, "", NULL)) as delayed_2avg,
count(*) as total_Flights,count(if(DepDelay > 19.16, "", NULL)) / count(*) as delayed_Rate from flightsInfo 
group by month,uniquecarrier order by month asc,delayed_Rate desc;

3. Top 10 weather delays
INSERT OVERWRITE DIRECTORY '/user/training/hiveOutput/delay_weather' select Month,origin,count(if(WeatherDelay > 0, "", NULL)) as WDelay 
from FlightsInfo group by Month,origin order by WDelay desc limit 10;

4. Old planes causing delay? on Top 50 Arrival Delays 
INSERT OVERWRITE DIRECTORY '/user/training/hiveOutput/delay_oldPlanes' select TailNum,UniqueCarrier,count(if(ArrDelay > 19.16, "", NULL)) as delayed_2avg,count(*) as totalFlights,
count(if(DepDelay > 19.16, "", NULL)) / count(*) as delayed_Rate from flightsInfo
group by UniqueCarrier,TailNum order by delayed_Rate desc limit 50;  

5. Cascading delay? Top 100 arrival and departure composed delays
INSERT OVERWRITE DIRECTORY '/user/training/hiveOutput/delay_cascade' select dayofmonth,month,UniqueCarrier,origin,dest,count(if(ArrDelay>15,"",NULL)) 
as arDelay,count(if(DepDelay>15,"",NULL)) as dpDelay, count(*) as totalFlights,
count(if(ArrDelay>15,"",NULL))/count(*) as arRate,count(if(DepDelay>15,"",NULL))/count(*) as dRate
from flightsInfo group by dayofmonth,month,UniqueCarrier,origin,dest order by arRate desc,dRate desc limit 50;
